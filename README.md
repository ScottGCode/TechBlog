# Tech Blog

## Description

As a developer who writes about tech I wanted a CMS-style blog site so that I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions. Becuase writing about tech can be just as important as making it. This application is similar to a Wordpress site as developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well. This helps developers stay up to date on tech! This app is deployed using Heroku and follows the MVC paradigm it its arcitechtural structure using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
